# Mobile Device Integration Tutorial

I produced a tutorial on mobile device integration through direct use of the software and collaboration with the developer.

## Set Up Mobile Devices

Before using your application on a mobile device via remote desktop connection, you must configure mobile settings in the Back Office.

### Step 1: Add Mobile  Device to System Devices

Each mobile device must be added to **System Devices** in the Back Office.  

> **Note:** If a mobile device is not added, the program will run in **demo mode** on the device.

#### To add a mobile device:

1. Log into the Back Office and select **Settings**.
2. Click **System Devices**.
3. Select **Terminals** and click **Add Terminal**.
4. Enter the **Computer Name** (retrieved from the mobile device settings).  
   Optionally, enter a **Description** for reference; it appears in the **Terminals** area in System Devices.
5. Click **OK**.
6. Click **File** and then **Save** to save your changes.

### Step 2: Activate Terminals

Activate the mobile option in **System Devices** to enable the program for mobile use.  

> **Note:** You must activate the mobile option for each mobile device. Depending on the device type, it is recommended to customize the screen and layout. 

#### To activate mobile terminals:

1. In **System Devices** (Back Office → Settings), select **Terminals**.
2. Go to the **General Info 2** tab (second row of tabs).
3. Check **This is a Handheld Terminal** to activate the selected device.
4. Click **File** and then **Save**.
5. To activate additional devices, select the desired handheld in the **Terminals** text box and check **This is a Handheld Terminal**.

**Result:**  
The devices are now configured and activated for use with the application. Each device added and activated will function correctly outside the demo mode.
